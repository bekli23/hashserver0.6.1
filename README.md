<div class="alert alert-success">Hi bekli23, Welcome back to F4lc0n Mining Wallet! - RULES: 
<br>- Assigns a percentage to each miner based on the time worked and the processing power contributed by each one. For example, if a miner has worked longer or provided more processing power, they could receive a larger share of the profits.

<br>- Allocate 20% of profits to admins and 10% to hunters who delivered bags. This can be done by simply subtracting these percentages from the total winnings.

<br>- Divide the remaining 70% among the hunters according to the time worked and the processing power contributed by each one. <br>if you need more information contact @f4lc0n90 or @romeo23r Telegram - remember to send your BTC payment address to the telegram, to pay you if we're lucky
